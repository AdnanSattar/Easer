# Donation

([DONATE.md](DONATE.md)是此文檔的中文版本)

Software development is a continuing process. It is kindly hoped to receive continuing monthly development / maintainance allowance.

If you like Easer and would like to see it developing well, please consider [supporting](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/easer). Any amout is welcome, and I kindly appreciate your support.

If you believe Easer lacks some functionality you needs and would like to pay for its development, you could consider creating a (Bounty) Issue.

If you believe other methods of donation would be useful or better, please contact me:
