Ease your life by automatically performing routine actions.

Introduction
-----
Make your smart phone smarter: tell it what to do under different situations.

You can think Easer as a local version of IFTTT: Trigger actions or change settings (*Operation*s, bundled as *Profile*) in different situations (*Event*).

You can chain *Event*s (set dependencies) as trees. Easer will perform Post-Order Traversal to load you Profile(s).

Interested in joining development / add more *Event*s or *Operation*s / optimising UI? Have a look at [HOWTO](HOWTO.en.md) and [TODO](TODO.en.md).

Also have a look at [wiki](https://github.com/renyuneyun/Easer/wiki), especially [FAQ](https://github.com/renyuneyun/Easer/wiki/FAQ).
